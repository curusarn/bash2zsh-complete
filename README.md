# bash2zsh-complete
~~Converts~~ Attempts to convert bash completion to zsh completion - much unstable, very alpha

## Bash to Zsh complete

### Usage

`go run bash2zsh-complete.go BASH_COMPLETION [> ZSH_COMPLETION]`  
Program writes a lot of info to stderr.  
Program writes ZSH_COMPLETION to stdout.  

### Disclaimer

- This is very immature project
- Your bash completion needs to be a zsh compatible script (http://slopjong.de/2012/07/02/compatibility-between-zsh-and-bash/)
- This only works with a subset of standard bash completion options and functions (create an issue)

### Issues

I am more than happy to make this tool work for your bash completion script - create an issue.
